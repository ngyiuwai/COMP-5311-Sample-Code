A Simple Blockchain Project for PolyU COMP5331 2018 Winter Semester



Planning to

- Replace teammate's code by my code

  (e.g.	Block will be rewrote in a more understandable way. And fixed the length of header, e.g. nonce = 5 --> nonce = 000005)
  (	Merkle Tree has some error. The tree building could be modified too)
  (	Database is slow. Maybe use some other data format, e.g. JSON/ XML but not external database library)
  (	TCP message size is fixed at 8kb. Should allow messages to be partition)
- Rewrite the ugly code

- Write an introduction with graphs (data flow dragram? UML?)

in late Dec 2018/ early Jan 2019
